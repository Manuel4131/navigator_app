This app is designed to display local pictures and songs. 
In this edition, the pictures target path is at DCIM directory
 and songs target path is at Music directory. 

About the design

When the picture button is pressed, an intent is sent
to start GridView activity showing the searched pictures.
And each row will display 4 items. The search function
is completed by service and broadcast receiver. As the
button is triggered, a service searching local pictures
is launched to find pictures in target path by using DFS
 algorithm. Whenever a picture is found, a broadcast is sent.
And as the receiver get the broadcast, it will update one portion
of the whole GridView. 
Any advice to the design is welcomed. :)
